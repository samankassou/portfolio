# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building web applications faster and more enjoyable. In this post, we'll explore the key features and how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 14?

Next.js 14 introduces several improvements:

- **Turbopack**: Faster local development with Turbopack
- **Server Actions**: Simplified data mutations

This will create a new Next.js project with all the latest features configured.

## App Router vs Pages Router

The App Router introduces a new paradigm:

```typescript
// app/page.tsx - Server Component by default
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js 14!</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## Key Benefits

3. **Simplified Data Fetching**: Async components and Server Actions
4. **Improved Developer Experience**: Better error handling and debugging
